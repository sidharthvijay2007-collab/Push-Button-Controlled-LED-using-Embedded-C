# Push-Button-Controlled-LED-using-Embedded-C
This project implements a robust state-machine for toggling an LED using a momentary push button. It demonstrates three core embedded concepts:  1. GPIO Handling (Abstraction) 2. Software Debouncing (Timing-based) 3. State Change Detection (Edge Triggering)
